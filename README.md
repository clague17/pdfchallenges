Three challenges including a Bucket challenge, a Number2Words generator, and a file identifier

BucketChallenge:
This was a tough challenge in that I had never seen anything like it before, but after a bit of reasoning about it, it didnt take me much to arrive at a working solution. 

NumberToWord: 
By far the most difficult of these challenges, just because of the creative aspect. I decided upon a number to color idea, where I will take an input of 10-20 digit number and parse it into respective rgb up to triples. 
Therein lay a problem: not all rgb colors are triples, and not all triples are named. In that edge case, this isn't so much a 'number to word' generator as it is a 'number to rgb' generator, but for that reason I included the option to view all colors. If a given rgb combination is not a named color, I return the list of 3-tuples, as well as a message prompting the user to look at ALL the colors. To run this program, copy paste the code and run as is. The GUI should be prompted, then input your number and click the return key on your keyboard to submit. Note: I assumed the input will be 10-20 digits, but the way I implemented allows for less than 10 and more than 20. 

Despite the number of arbitrary decisions I had to make in this project, I am happy with the overall finished product. 
I added a picture to the GUI to make it a little less boring. 

TwoFileChallenge:
I typed up the report in the LaTeX file attached as a pdf.
